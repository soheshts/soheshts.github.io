# How to theme a Linux Desktop Environment easily

If you are a linux based OS user, there is a chance that you might not like the look of your windows or the icons the OS comes with. You wanted to change it but sometimes it might get too technical and you may end up breaking stuffs. Here is a way you can install themes or icons a click away. By the way, I am using gnome desktop environment for below steps. Somethings might change for other environments.


1.	Go to pling.com and download the pling-store AppImage file.

2.	Right click the AppImage -> properties -> Permissions -> Allow executing File as a 			  program. Now double click the appimage file to run it. 


3.	You can download/install a lot of things other than themes and icons from here. I am going to choose 'gnome' from the list to get options related to my desktop environment.
