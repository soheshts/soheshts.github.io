# How I built this site
This whole site is hosted in Github and is completely open-source. For UI design, [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) is used. As per UIKit's site, it is
> A lightweight and modular front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.

Blogging is inspired by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Each blog posts are created in a markdown file.
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. 

Using, Jquery, content from these files are loaded and by using [Showdown JS](http://showdownjs.com/), the markdown is converted to HTML and is displayed before the user.
